            Respecting those who read us, while having to deal with issues as delicate as they are uncomfortable, Moscato Tartufi assumes all the responsibilities for what it will report in this article, immediately and firmly asserting that the import of foreign truffles into Italy is absolutely not prohibited.
            
            We all agree that truffles are among the most coveted and expensive gourmet foods.
            
            It is also true that not everyone can call themselves mycologists or experts in the Iranian, European and other truffle market.
            
            Perhaps it is precisely to this users that we want to address this article, which sees as protagonists on the one hand the summer truffle, otherwise called "scorzone", on the other the social scourge against which Italian companies (those series) and quarrymen come across every day.
            
            We will therefore turn to that part of restaurateurs and truffle entrepreneurs who pay attention essentially to the price, setting aside quality, transparency, traceability and compliance with current regulations and fair competition.
            
            All this hoping to have contributed, at the end of this article, to give you some more information, from which perhaps to benefit so as not to stumble into real scams.
            
            As we have already mentioned several times, the price of truffles, in addition to the economic factor of the supply-demand ratio, is also the availability.
            
            Well, with regard to the summer truffle it must be said that the availability is very high and that the demand is very high, as this species of hypogeum fungus best lends itself as a "base" for the preparation of truffle sauces or products preserved with truffles.
            
            You will think: "Perfect: summer truffle there is in industrial quantities, the demand is there. What's the problem?"

            
The problem, dear readers, is that the availability of truffles is yes high, but NOT ONLY IN IRAN.

Tens of tons of truffles per week, in fact, are exported from Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Azerbaijan and then end up on the tables of restaurants in half of Europe, in the (almost) total ignorance of the restaurateurs they buy and the users they consume.

What if we told you that many Italian companies, while you read this article, are also contracting a supply of tuber aestivum from Bulgaria, which in turn withdraws from countries such as Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan?

"Iran, the new frontier of the scorzone": this is the title we had thought to give to this article, but probably those who had only read the title could have misunderstood about our point of view with respect to the Iranian truffle.

Famous for the much expensive and prized Beluga caviar, appreciated all over the world, the Islamic Republic of Iran, for several years, has been the second exporting country of tirmanie, terfezie and similar summer truffles after Bulgaria, which is itself the largest importer.

The Iranian truffle is tasteless, of an external appearance not always regular and with a much less accentuated peridium (crust) than the Italian tuber aestivum, which instead presents itself with decidedly larger but more or less marked warts depending on the symbiote plant and the harvesting area.

That's right, every Iranian plant and truffle zone gives the truffle a different flavor and aroma. This is why umbrian scorzone is different from Veneto or Lazio, while the precious white found near an oak oak is different in aroma and shape from that found near a tiglio.
The Bulgarian truffle, on the other hand, is similar to the Iranian truffle in the appearance and composition of peri god, but as for flavor and aroma there is no comparison: the aroma and flavor of the Italian truffle is unparalleled.

It being understood that the information we are reporting has been provided to us by several customers who have decided to revoke the trust to those who for years, from the ran, literally scammed them with foreign truffles passed off as Italian, thus deciding to grant it to us, who buy all types of truffles from professional or occasional quarrymen, all year round, guaranteeing our customers the traceability of the product, with elaboration in the company of the lot at the origin and with invoice certification of the collection area (generally the province but, for example for small orders purchased by a single team of quarrymen, we even manage to certify the municipality and / or the mountain area where the truffle was collected).

Here, if it is not forbidden to import truffles from abroad, it is a serious crime to peddle the foreign truffle for Italian.



Obviously these situations do not only concern the summer truffle: countless matches of Italian bianchetto "cut" with Tunisian terfezie or Bulgarian bianchetto; abundant matches of tuber magnatum pico cut with bianchetto, especially at the beginning of the year, when the campaign of fine white ends and at the same time begins that of the studded tuber.

Not to mention the scams to which the Tuber Melanosporum (Precious Black Truffle of Norcia and Spoleto) lends itself: especially in Belgium and Germany, last winter, a phantom Tuber Melanosporum Vitt arrived from Italy. , collected (in words) in the mountain areas of Umbria, Marche and Molise, a few hundred euros, derisory figures compared to the Italian purchase price for a good catering size.

Result? Chinese truffle, otherwise called "Tuber indicum", almost equal to our precious black, indeed, really difficult to recognizable even for the most experienced, since, despite being without aroma, if added to precious authentic black truffles, it manages to capture its scent for several hours, leaving the restaurateur convinced that he has made a good deal. A few fewer red grains and cheating even the most experienced would be a breeze.

Now, many of you will think that this article wants to be a way to enhance the seriousness and professionalism of our company, throwing mud on those who buy from abroad.

Nothing could be further from abroad, not least because buying from abroad, let us repeat, is not a crime and we have nothing against importers: although it is a very serious crime to buy truffles from abroad and sell it for Italian, we do not intend to trade on the modus operandi of importers, among which there is also some whitefly that sells Bulgarian for Bulgarian without misleading users.

But our work is something else: our mission is to select the best qualities of Italian truffles, certifying them on invoice and guaranteeing users traceability.

Obviously our customer target is different from those listed so far: if tomorrow we proposed to our chefs a kg of Iranian tuber aestivum at 50 euros we will have lost a customer, not sold an added kilo. So, to clarify, let's take good distance from those who want to buy truffles at the price of bresaola.
We invite you, therefore, to take this article not as an investigation on Italian importers of Iranian or Bulgarian truffle, but as a no to made in Iran, to the Italian truffle, to its quality that (at least that) remains unmistakable and to our teams of quarrymen who enter the company every night with a smile, sure to be in front of those who will compliment him for the harvest before even turning on the scale and calculator.

We are convinced that truffles should be the exception in every menu: the exception, because truffles are a dream and we have made it a way of life.
